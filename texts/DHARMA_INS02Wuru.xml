This is an original single copper plate which is engraved on its both sides. Seven lines stand on the <foreign>recto, </foreign>four lines on the <foreign>verso</foreign>, bringing the total lines to eleven. The provenance of this plate is unidentified, yet it might come from the Yogyakarta area since it was J.A. Dieduksman, a Dutch official who was residing in Jogja, who donated this plate to BG and asked Brandes to decipher it. Its current whereabouts is unknown, possibly it has been lost. A facsimile of this plate is said to be kept in the Puslit Arkenas, which nowadays is reorganized as Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional (BRIN). Alas, it is in a poor condition according to Damais. The measurements of this plate have never been recorded anywhere.
NBG 1896: 53, Brandes 1913: 37 (no. XXIX).
Damais 1952: 51, n.8 (no. A. 91), Damais 1955: 49, n.3.
The first edition of this plate was made by Brandes which later was published in OJO (1913). Later, it was re-edited by Sarkar (1971–72, vol. II) in which he provided the first translation in English. Wisseman Christie in her 1996 article provided a partial English translation which she declared is a bit different from what Sarkar had provided. Edhie Wurjantoro (2018) published the Indonesian translation as well as the transcription without mentioning which edition he uses. Recently, the inscription has been restudied by Arlo Griffiths as part of the DHARMA project using Brandes&#x27; transcription as well as Damais’ readings that can be inferred from citations of passages in his onomastic repertory (1970). The edition presented here is solely based on Griffiths’ reading, complemented with comments by Tyassanti Kusumo Dewanti.
Brandes 1913: 36 (no. XXIX).
Sarkar 1971–72, vol. II: 135–37 (no. LXXXI).
Wisseman Christie 1996: 282, appendix 6.
Edhie Wurjantoro 2018: 243–44.
Apart from the studies made for establishing a reading, this charter is also integrated in the inventories compiled by Damais (1952) and Nakada (1982). The study of the date was carried out by Damais (1955), resulting in the CE date 8 March 912.
Damais 1952: 50–51 (no. A. 91), Nakada 1982: 96–97 (no. I. 105).
Damais 1955: 49–50.
This charter records a clearance of a debt made by the father of <foreign>ḍaṅ </foreign>Navi to Master (<foreign>mpu guru</foreign>)<foreign> </foreign>Daya.

        <p>(1r1–6) Śaka 833, month of Phālguna, second (tithi) of the waning fortnight, Mavulu, Vagai‚ Sunday. [That] was the time that <foreign>ḍaṁ</foreign> Navī repaid the debt of his/her father to Master (<foreign>mpu</foreign> <foreign>guru</foreign>) Ḍayā. The repayment for it was 16 <foreign>suvarṇa</foreign>, 10 <foreign>māṣa</foreign>, 2 <foreign>kupaṅ</foreign>, and 5 <foreign>hatak</foreign>. <foreign>pu</foreign> Latī, father of Bayal, resident of the village of Vuru Tuṅgal, <foreign>tutuganniṅ taṇḍa</foreign>, together with <foreign>pu</foreign> Vijah, father of Bhūmi, (also) resident of the village of Vuru Tuṅgal, received the gold. The debt of <foreign>ḍaṁ</foreign> Navī to the Master Ḍayā was cleared (<foreign>śuddha</foreign>).</p>
        <p>(1r6–1v3) The witnesses to it were: <foreign>saṅ </foreign>Təguhan, resident of the village of Pilaṅ, <foreign>vatak</foreign> of Paṅgil Hyaṅ; <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Ta[...], resident of the village of Valakas, <foreign>vatak</foreign> of Valakas;<foreign> saṅ </foreign>Bhāskara, resident of the village of Valaiṅ, <foreign>vatak</foreign> of Valaiṅ; <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Pakambaṅan, resident of the village of Taṅga,<foreign> vatak</foreign> of Hino; <foreign>saṅ</foreign> Ra Tira, resident of the village of Limo, <foreign>vatak</foreign> of Pagar Vsi. The document was written by the Lord of Pilaṅ.</p>

      <div type="commentary">
        <p>1r2 The use of <foreign>bapa </foreign>instead of the common <foreign>rāma </foreign>to denote “father” throughout this charter (recurs in 1r4, 1r5) is peculiar.</p>
        <p>1r5 On the term <foreign>tutuganniṅ taṇḍa</foreign>, AG left a comment: this expression, occurring in several inscriptions of the Central Javanese period, seem literally to mean ‘incisions of the mark’, ‘the engraving of the sign’ or ‘up to the limit of the sign’. The contextual meaning is obscure. But the translation ‘who signed [the document]’ offered by Wisseman Christie (2009: 180), connecting the expression to the name of a person, is unlikely to be correct, as the expression is normally associated with toponyms. To that matter, Griffiths in his <foreign>vihāra </foreign>article (forthcoming), argues that it stands as a toponymic reference. The word <foreign>taṇḍa </foreign>might refer to a boundaries, possibly boundary markers, of a certain village. As a comparison, Griffiths connects this idea to the concept of boundary and mark in the Old English word <foreign>mearc</foreign>, which later delivers the words “mark” and “march”.</p>
        <p>1v1 The toponym <foreign>valeṁ</foreign> is also mentioned in other inscriptions in the Daksa corpus, in the Wintang Mas and Tulang Er inscriptions, though in the latter it is written in a different spelling, viz. <foreign>baleṁ.</foreign></p>
        <p>1v3 <foreign>pagar vsi </foreign>already appeared in the inscription as a district (<foreign>vatak</foreign>) since 798 Saka, in the Jurungan inscription and the last one is in Lintakan inscription, dated to 841 Saka. From this list, we can reconstitute some villages that belong to the <foreign>pagar vsi </foreign>district. Those are Juruṅan (Jurungan 1v2, Lintakan 1r12), Kalaṅkyaṅ (Kayu Ara Hiwang A17), Kukap (Rongkab 1r5), Watu-watu (Kasugihan 1r3), Limo (Wuru Tunggal 1v3), Kahuripan (Lintakan 2r3) and Pakalaṅkyaṅan (Panggumulan 2v1, Lintakan 3r8). Here, the last village mentioned seems to refer to the same place as the which is mentioned in the Kayu Ara Hiwang inscription as Kalaṅkyaṅ. For cross reference o this toponym, see the note for 1.23 in Taji Gunung.</p>
