                        </bibl> summarized most of the noteworthy palaeographic aspects of the inscription. His observations concerned: (1) the shape of <foreign>t</foreign> and <foreign>m</foreign> in combination with <foreign>virāma</foreign>; (2) the shape and position of the <foreign>repha</foreign>; (3) the shape of postconsonantal <foreign>y</foreign>, and the special shape of the ligature <foreign>rya</foreign>; (4) the two allographs of the vowel marker <foreign>e</foreign>; (5) the decorative flourish sometimes given to the vowel marker <foreign>i</foreign>; (6) the shapes of <foreign>ja</foreign> and <foreign>jā</foreign>; (7) the inconsistent gemination of consonants after <foreign>r</foreign>; (8) the shape of <foreign>na</foreign>; (9) the use of <foreign>ṅ</foreign> instead of <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> before <foreign>ś</foreign> and <foreign>h</foreign>. To these I add one more: (10) the presence of two allographs of vowel marker <foreign>ū</foreign>. I will now elaborate on the above points, proceeding item by item.</p>
                     <p>(1) Special shape of <foreign>m</foreign> with virāma, represented as <foreign>M</foreign>: see stanzas II, III VII and XII. By contrast, I read n· (meaning that the basic consonant sign seems to have it normal shape and position) in puruṣān·, pārthivendrān·, ... .</p>
                     <p>(2) shape of repha: can we read rjya in st. II or not? very clear examples in lines 7 (rmma), 11 (rthi, rmma, rna) </p>
                     <p>(3) Pāla shape of rya seen throughout — check also Bosch</p>
                     <p>(4) two allographs of the marker -e: elaborate top-stroke in dakṣiṇeyam (line 9), kāle kāle and Anena puṇyena (line 12), etc.;  normally a vertical strole at left.</p>
                     <p>(5) The final akṣara <foreign>ti</foreign> in <foreign>iti</foreign> at the end of line 14 is written in the extended manner commonly seen in Siddhamātr̥kā inscriptions. Brandes write ’sometimes’. Are there any other cases?</p>
                     <p>(6) Stanza VI pūjārthaṁ: I have some trouble telling this jā apart from ja signs elsewhere. Cf. e.g. in rājasiṁhena, l. 9; rājasiṅhaḥ in 11. But cf. jātārtha in l. 12. The difference seems to lie herein, that in the case of jā, the ā-mātra does not descend from the top-line, but ascends from the middle diagonal of ja.</p>
                     <p>(7) Gemination of C after r if C = m. No gemination of C after r if C = y, n, th.</p>
                     <p>(8), (9)</p>
                     <p>(10) two allographs of -ū: bhū (end line 8) and bhū in line 9.</p>
                     <!-- Damais 1952: 24 note "Au début de la strophe 8 la transcription de Brandes et de Bosch, bhura, ne convient pas paléographiquement parlant. Le petit trait transversal à gauche de l'r si c'en était un, serait placé bien trop bas et ne devrait pas toucher ce qui, dans ce cas, serait l'aksara précédent. Bhura ne voulant rien dire pour autant que nous sachions,
c'est bien bhü qu'il faut lire, avec Bhandarkar, bien que l'aksara diffère sensiblement des autres bhû de cette inscription (lignes 11 et 14) par l'adjonction d'un trait vertical superfétatoire qui peut être considéré du même ordre que les variétés exagérément allongées de la voyelle -e que l'on trouve ici à côté de la forme courte qui est juste une petite boucle. -->

<!--NOTES BHANDARKAR
1 This may also be translated as ''the only star of the Universe."
2 The Upāyas or means are three. (See Dharmasaṁgraha , Max Müller's Ed. CXI.)
3 Śailendra, literally means "the lord of mountains," and the phrase Śailendrarāja may be translated as "king of the mountainous country." But it must be taken here as the name of a king. He is called Śailendravarma in the sixth line, of which name the latter part varma is the usual affix of the
names of Kṣatriyas; and his son is represented as reigning at the time when the temple was built. In the ninth line the plural of the name with the word bhūpa added to it is used, and the phrase literally means "the kings Śailendravarmas." This could be taken as the plural honorific; but at the time when the inscription was cut, Śailendra was not on the throne, but his son; wherefore the plural is to be understood in the sense of "the descendants of Śailendra." It will be seen in the remarks that I identify Śailendra with the prince Śela Prawat, whose name occurs in one of the lists given by Sir Stamford Raffles.
4 These are un-Sanskrit names, and must be the titles in old Javanese of the leading men or officers of districts and villages resembling the hereditary officers of India. They are spoken of as Deśādhyakṣas or ‘‘leaders of the country" below.
8 See the above note.
6 The word which I read suṇṇa must be a word expressive of praise as sat is, which is used in connection with Tavāna, and sādhu which is applied to the Pattis. It seems to be the Prakrit of the Sanskrit sujña.
7 Twelve things are mentioned in the Buddhistic treatises, each subsequent one of which is produced from each preceding, and this constitutes the chain of causes and effects upon which depends the worldly existence of man. When this chain is known and efforts are made to destroy the first
link, a man is free from worldly existence and attains Nirvāṇa. The technical term by which this causation is known is Pratītyotpāda (Dharmasaṁgraha, Max Müller's Ed., pp. 9 and 43, or any other Buddhistic work).
8 This is another name of the king. See the "Remarks."

<!--<head>Javanese aspects</head>-->
<p>Sanskritization of Javanese words: De Casparis 1950: 135 n. 4; Damais 1952: 24 note</p>
<p>I disagree with Damais 1952: 25 note, who argues against the reading <foreign>pattibhiś</foreign>. I interpret this word as Sanskritization (with double <foreign>tt</foreign> imposed by the meter) for Old Javanese <foreign>patih</foreign>. The idea that the three compounds ending in -<foreign>ādibhiḥ</foreign> are grammatically adjectives to <foreign>pattibhis</foreign>, and express the hierarchical superiority of the Paṅkur-Tavan-Tirip triad to the <foreign>patih</foreign>s is inspired by such inscriptions as Kwak I, where the Paṅkur named <foreign>pu</foreign> Gava, the Tavān <foreign>pu</foreign> Rañjan and the Tirip <foreign>pu</foreign> Agrapiṇḍa are named at the top of a list of high officials, while several named <foreign>patih</foreign>s follow lower in the list.</p>
<p>upāya in BHSD; email PDS 2020-03-30: One more thing, I don’t know what the three kinds of upāya are, but the late 8th-c. Vilāsavajra in his Nāmamantrārthāvalokinī commentary to the Mañjuśrīnāmasaṃgīti has this: upāyas trividhaḥ | svadoṣāpakarṣaṇaḥ sattvāvatārakaḥ kṣiprābhisambodhakaś ca || [Ms = Cambridge University Library Add. 1708, palm-leaf, ff. 115, 26 missing. 33r]</p>
<p>The reading <foreign>āvarjya</foreign> is not evident from the stone, but must be what was intended here, because <foreign>āvarjayati</foreign> is virtually a technical term to describe what bodhisattvas do, namely to win people over and convert them to the Buddhist path. See BSHD.</p>
