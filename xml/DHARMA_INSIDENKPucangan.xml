                    suspected by Damais at the end of line 2. Although we thus read <em>dhama</em>
                    instead of <em>dhāma</em>, on the grounds that the intended meaning of the name

                    Several factors conspire to make the reading rather uncertain here. First, there
                    is interference with the descender (itself rather unclear) of <em>ṅku</em> in
                    the preceding line; what previous scholars have read, and what we read after
                    them, as <em>mb</em> could possibly be <em>ṅk</em> or <em>jb</em>; the squiggle
                    to its top left, which might be taken as -<em>ā</em> on <em>mb</em> pushed to
                    the left by the descender from line 15, seems indeed to be an -<em>i</em> on the
                    preceding akṣara, as previous editors assumed, and as we find confirmed by an
                    apparently parallel passage in the <seg rend="check">Kamalagyan inscription,
                        lines 21–22: <em>yāvat kavaṅunaniṅ yaśa donanya, an kapva kinalimbaṅ juga

                        <em>khaduḥkha</em>; in K’s, there is a lacuna of five akṣaras after <em>haji
                        m</em> at the end of 39, while line 40 starts with <em>sukhaduḥkha</em>. In
                    cases where it could be verified, we have seen that K’s edition is not very
                    precise in dealing with the distinction between preserved and conjectured text;
                    moreover, the amount of space before the first legible akṣaras on line 40
                    suggests that B’s reading of the beginning of this line has a more plausible
                    number of akṣaras. We therefore conjecture that the necessary akṣara <em>su</em>
                    stood at the end of line 39. If we may otherwise rely on K’s edition, it means
                    the lacuna between <em>m</em> and <em>su</em> extends over four akṣaras. If this

                    confirm any of the sequences of akṣaras that our predecessors have discerned on
                    this line. We see a fairly clear <em>ṅi</em> around the 12th position in the
                    line, but what remains of the surrounding akṣaras cannot be matched with Kern’s
                    conjecture <em>maṅilāla</em>; three positions to the left of this ṅi stands a
                    clear <em>na</em> which may also have been a <em>ne</em>. The number of
                    illegible akṣaras indicated by Kern implies that there were only 25 akṣaras on
                    this line which must be far off the mark as completely preserved lines higher up
                    show around 55 akṣaras per line. But we are unable to propose an alternative
                    estimate because we are unable to situate the string of akṣaras read by B and K
                    anywhere on the line. Note that B’s text suggests mvaṁ stood at the end of the
                    line, whereas K’s suggests a short lacuna stood between this word and the end of

                    expected entire number of akṣaras for this line into account, and estimating the
                    distance between the akṣaras that are still preserved today, we estimate that
                    the gap which was already present in our predecessors’ time extended over at

                due to the attack of the king of Vuravari who came out of Lva Rām. At that time, the
                whole of Java resembled one great sea. Many distinguished men died. First and
                foremost did die at that time the late Great King who rests at the holy temple
                foundation in Vvatan. It was in the month of Caitra of the [year of the] Śaka era
                939. The Great King was still a child at that time. In fact he was sixteen years of
                age. He was not very experienced in battle, because he was still young. He was not
                at ease at quickly grasping the ways of handling his weapons. But because he was
                manifestly an incarnation of Viṣṇu, he was the protégé of all the gods, destined not
                to be among those who succumbed to the force of the great disaster, as he stayed on
                the slope of the Vanagiri, conversing with the ascetics of pure conduct [and] being
                accompanied by his servant, whose mind had focused dedication as his bodily services
                were skilled [and] as he was bowed in devotion to the dust on slippers of the Great
                King. His name was Pu Narottama. He was the foremost of the servants of the Great
                King extraordinary in the steadfastness of his devotion, who followed inseparably to
                the Great King’s every destination, wearing bark garments like the Great King, and
                accompanying him in taking all the types of food<note>Or: ‘taking the same types of
                    food...’.</note> of monks and forest-dwellers. The Great King was never
                negligent in the propitiation of the gods by day and by night. It was the reason of
                the great weight of the love of all the gods for his the Great King, so that he
                became their confidant [in the form of] a wish tree to give the world shade, to
                succeed to his paternal lineage (<foreign>kulit kaki</foreign>) in owning Royal
                Fortune, to refresh the constant well-being (<foreign>sāśvatā</foreign>) of the
                world, to restore all holy foundations, [and] to destroy the evil powers
                    (<foreign>hanitu</foreign>) of the world. Such was the intention of all the gods
                concerning the Great King.</p>
            <p n="13–15"> The Great King had already undergone due rites, was installed on the lion
