                        and hence that the word we are dealing with here had to have the value 9.

                        previous editors assumed, and as we find confirmed by an apparently parallel
                        passage in the <seg rend="check">Kamalagyan inscription, lines 21–22:

                        have seen that K’s edition is not very precise in dealing with the
                        distinction between preserved and conjectured text; moreover, the amount of

                        55 akṣaras per line. But we are unable to propose an alternative estimate
                        because we are unable to situate the string of akṣaras read by B and K
                        anywhere on the line. Note that B’s text suggests mvaṁ stood at the end of
                        the line, whereas K’s suggests a short lacuna stood between this word and

                    calculated a posteriori for that year, once the inversion 872/782 had been made,

                    discussion in Boechari 1962: 78–79 n. 43 = 2012: 79–80, n. 24. One might think

                    our poet would have been capable of finding a less ambiguous solution to express
                    this. On the other hand this verse might continue the parallelism with Rāma, who

                at the time of the disaster on the island of Java in the [year of the] Śaka era 939,
                due to the attack of the king of Vuravari who came out of Lva Rām. At that time, the
                whole of Java resembled one great sea. Many distinguished men died. First and
                foremost did die at that time the late Great King who rests at the holy temple
                foundation in Vvatan. It was in the month of Caitra of the [year of the] Śaka era
                939. The Great King was still a child at that time. In fact he was sixteen years of
                age. He was not very experienced in battle, because he was still young. He was not
                at ease at quickly grasping the ways of handling his weapons. But because he was
                manifestly an incarnation of Viṣṇu, he was the protégé of all the gods, destined not
                to be among those who succumbed to the force of the great disaster, as he stayed on
                the slope of the Vanagiri, conversing with the ascetics of pure conduct [and] being
                accompanied by his servant, whose mind had focused dedication as his bodily services
                were skilled [and] as he was bowed in devotion to the dust on slippers of the Great
                King. His name was Pu Narottama. He was the foremost of the servants of the Great
                King extraordinary in the steadfastness of his devotion, who followed inseparably to
                the Great King’s every destination, wearing bark garments like the Great King, and
                accompanying him in taking all the types of food<note>Or: ‘taking the same types of
                    food...’.</note> of monks and forest-dwellers. The Great King was never
                negligent in the propitiation of the gods by day and by night. It was the reason of
                the great weight of the love of all the gods for his the Great King, so that he
                became their confidant [in the form of] a wish tree to give the world shade, to
                succeed to his paternal lineage (<foreign>kulit kaki</foreign>) in owning Royal
                Fortune, to refresh the constant well-being (<foreign>sāśvatā</foreign>) of the
                world, to restore all holy foundations, [and] to destroy the evil powers
                    (<foreign>hanitu</foreign>) of the world. Such was the intention of all the gods
                concerning the Great King.</p>
