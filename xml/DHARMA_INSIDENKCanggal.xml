Note that Vogel (p.~443) reports the discovery of a fragment, broken off from the last line, that preserves an akṣara which he reads as <foreign>thu} or <foreign>dhu}. I agree that it can be both (see photo OD 13392, published as pl.~49 in \OV\ 1938), but it is certainly not <foreign>bhu} (Sarkar). Although, when compared with the °<foreign>śe}° in l.~24, Kern’s reading of this akṣara seems uncertain here, I assume the stone read <foreign>aṅśaśeṣo dhunā} before damage. This seems the most suitable combination of all elements to be taken into account in the restitution of the lacuna. The alternatives that I have thought of are: <foreign>aṅgaśeṣo} (but the <foreign>ṅśa} is certain); <foreign>aṅśabhedo} (but what remains visible of the akṣara before <foreign>thu/dhu} on the fragment does not allow reading it as <foreign>do}); and <foreign>aṅśato mithunā} (which would  fit best the available traces of letters but does not seem to make any sense).}% See print of email Dominic Goodall.}

No factual conclusions with regard to the availability of gold mines in the landscape known to the poet may be drawn from a statement such as this. Likewise, it is a convention of Sanskrit poetical narrative to mark transitions with the verb <foreign>āsīt</foreign> which, even though formally an imperfect tense, has no specific preterite implications (see in this reader the inscriptions Kāñjuruhan, st. I and Pucangan, st. V, XI, XXIII).

<p rend="stanza" n="8">On that fine island called Yava, which was a great mark of the foot of Puruṣa (Viṣṇu), for a long time a king of mighty and lofty birth, of extensive and great fame, due to the proper [application of policies of] pacification and donation, who ruled all subjects, like a father [disciplines] a son <seg rend="check">from birth, out of tenderness</seg>, called Sanna, to whom enemies bowed down (<foreign>sannata</foreign>), ruled the earth with righteousness, like Manu.<note>Here (<foreign>pāti</foreign>) and in the following verses, the present tense forms have to be interpreted as <foreign>praesens historicum</foreign>.</note></p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9">When the moon in his own lineage called Sanna, who ruled the royal fortune (i.e., the earth) in this manner, had passed his time, and had proceeded to the happiness in heaven, <seg rend="check">accumulated by those born in his own family</seg>, the shattered world roamed under grief's reins, being bereft of a king.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10">Then was born [a king] who was, by the profusion of his numerous qualities, like Meru: the radiance of his fair complexion was like the gold <seg rend="check">(on Meru)</seg> molten by flaming fire; he was very high by the lower slopes that were his great arms and lofty by the peak that was his head; the elevation of his high feet (or: lower reaches) was underpinned by the kings (<foreign>kṣitidhara</foreign>) that were the principal mountain ranges.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11">The illustrious king called Sañjaya, to be honored by the multitudes of wise men knowledgable in the subtle meaning of the teachings; endowed with the qualities of wisdom, heroism and so forth, having, like Raghu, conquered the circuit of numerous vassals;<note>This hemistisch alludes to cantoes 3 and 4 of the <title>Raghuvaṁśa</title>, dealing respectively with Raghu's education and his <foreign>digvijaya</foreign>.</note>  being, by his fame, renowned in [all] the cardinal and intermediate directions, as is the Sun; the son of the sister of the king named Sannāha, he justly rules the kingdom.</p>
