Do you consider that non-spelling of expected layars is a feature of this writing tradition? If yes, then the case of sakavarsa in line 8 can be treated analogously. If no, then why not use <supplied reason="omitted"> here and in line 8? In either case, the fact that some expected layars are invisible or simply have not been written may merit a note in metadata, and, for want of a better place, can be added to the comments at the bottom of the file.

I was not sure whether it qualified for an eccentric-ductus tag, but I would agree with this solution. / argr2masc: after new consideration, why not simply ha<unclear>m</unclear>ideni or even hamideni — from the photos of the stone, I find it rather unproblematic to read hamideni with m and this is  anyhow the reading that we want to get a MJ manifestation of amidhyani.
