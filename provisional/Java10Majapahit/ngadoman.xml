He makes the interesting point that this script has more in common with that used in inscriptions of the Central Javanese period, showing that a number of akṣaras do not display innovations that occurred through the East-Javanese period (<bibl rend="omitname">

Adding that: several times in this inscription some expected layars are invisible (case of non-spelling?), or simply have not been written. This may well be a more pervasive feature of the writing tradition this inscription pertains to. So too the pervasive phenomenon of denasalisation of clusters with the structure NC (on this phenomenon, see Noorduyn & Teeuw 2006). -->
